My name is Robert J.

Made by John Conway in 1970, The Game of Life is a Cellular Automation simulator. I'm attmepting to re-create the masterpiece in Java, using the IDE NetBeans.

The project is currently under development and will hopefully be fully created, tested, and built so that it can become available to any who wish to play it, although many versions exist on the web that are probably much better than mine. 

FEATURES:
- I intend to add presets that you can play with and help you learn how to better play the game of life, as you can make quite a few automations using the basic rules John Conway implemented in the game cleverly. I do not currently know much
  about how to do these complex automations as I am writing, but will learn in an attmept to imporove the project.
- I also want to add some customizability options for the user to improve the game experience.
- May add a tutorial because this game is really confusing and I have no idea how people came up with some of the stuff you can do in it.
- Like what the heck is a glider and woah it travels.
- Could do some cool animations for some of the "explosions", no idea how that will turn out though.
- Some sound effects, could be annoying
- Music, made by yours truly

Yes this is for fun.
Yes this is to help me get a job :D

Happy Coding
